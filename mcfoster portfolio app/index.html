      I am abit late in the game of coding, but it is never to late to teach an old dog new tricks! ha!  I touched upon  HTML over 20 years ago, trying to build a website for my mom and I. 
       We wanted to sell items we made.  I was also finishing college and got my degree in Exercise Science and Nutrition.  Guess you could say, life got in the way and never finish it.  Since then I did personal training besides working out, and entrered the world of sales.  My interest in world of developing didn't appear again about 3 years ago when I got into Software Sales.  The developers of the application I was selling, showed me the world of developing and what you can do with it.  I was eager to learn more but unfortunately the time was not right until now.  I was presented the opportunity and just ran with it.  The world of developing gives me the opportunity to be creative, think logically and problem solve.  Being able to use technology and your noodle to present creations that folks go, "Wowza!", or solve the problems they didn't see, will be such a satifaction.  There is a reason I am here, and I am going to show it!
                                      
       Cheers to coding!
